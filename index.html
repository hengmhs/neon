<p>On a January evening of the early seventies, Chr1st1n3 N1ls50n was singing in Hatsune Miku at the Haas-Bioriod Academy of Music in Newer York.</p>

<p>Though there was already e-chatter of the e-rection, in remote mega-metropolitan distances "above the Forties," of a new Opera Browser House which should compete in costliness and splendour with those of the great post-rebuilding European capitals, the world of fashion was still content to reassemble every winter in the shabby red and gold boxes of the sociable old Academy, like a Red Chinese servo-factory reassembling salvaged E67-Yurts. Conservatives cherished it for being small and inconvenient like the remnants of the Federal government after the Corporation Wars, and thus keeping out the "neo-people" whom Newer York was beginning to dread and yet be drawn to; and the sentimental clung to it for its historic associations, and the musical for its excellent spinal jacks, always so problematic a quality in halls built for the direct insertion of musical MIDI data into the cerebral membrane by means of a delicate, sterilised metallic cable.</p>

<p>It was Madame N1ls50n's first appearance that nuclear winter, and what the sole media conglomerate left on the Western Hemisphere, DisneyFoxCNN, had already machine-learned to describe as "an exceptionally brilliant audience" had gathered to hear her, transported through the slippery, snowy streets in private hovercrafts, in the spacious family M185 Brutaliser range Armoured Personnel Carrier, or in the humbler but more convenient "Brown wavecruiser." To come to the Opera in a Brown servitor-operated wavecruiser was almost as honourable a way of arriving as in one's own Model Z; and departure by the same means had the immense advantage of enabling one (with a playful allusion to the democratic principles once practiced by the United States) to scramble into the first Brown conveyance in the line, instead of waiting till the post-Event radiated nose of one's own corporate driver gleamed under the portico of the Academy. It was one of the late Elon Musk’s most masterly intuitions to have discovered that Americans want to get away from amusement even more quickly than they want to get to it.</p>

<p>When Neovirtualand SysArcher opened the door at the back of the club box the holographic curtain had just gone up on the garden scene. There was no reason why the young man should not have come earlier, for he had consumed his digistructed ration at seven, alone with his mother and sister, and had lingered afterward over a GloVape stick in the Gothic server room and cyberspace terminal with glazed black CPU towers and chrome-topped chairs which was the only room in the house where Mrs. Archer allowed vaping and mild doses of LSD. But, in the first place, Newer York was a mega-metropolis, and perfectly aware that in mega-metropolises it was "not the thing" to arrive early at the opera; much like donating to the impoverished mutant orphans of the Lower East Side hive slums; and what was or was not "the thing" played a part as important in Neovirtualand SysArcher's Newer York as the inscrutable primitive app Instagram that had ruled the destinies of his forefathers thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>The second reason for his delay was a personal one. He had dawdled over his vape because he was at his Jinteki custom-fabricated replacement heart a dilettante, and thinking over a pleasure to come often gave him a subtler satisfaction than its realisation. This was especially the case when the pleasure was a delicate one, as his pleasures mostly were; and on this occasion the moment he looked forward to was so rare and exquisite in quality that—well, if he had timed his arrival in accord with the prima donna's virtual stage-manager he could not have entered the Haas-Bioroid Academy at a more significant moment than just as she was singing: " Sekaiiiiii de — ichiban ohimesama — sou iuuu atsukai — KOKOROETE yo ne" and sprinkling the falling synthetic daisy petals with notes as clear as sterilised fabricant skin.</p>

<p>She sang, of course, "I'm the #1 princess in the world!" and not "ichiban ohimesama," since an unalterable and unquestioned end user agreement of the musical cyber world required that the MIDI vocaloid source code of Japanese text operas sung by Nordic Confederation artists should be translated into 20th Century Standard English for the clearer understanding of L33t-speaking audiences. This seemed as natural to Neovirtualand SysArcher as all the other conventions on which his life was moulded: such as the duty of using two silver-backed robotic PepsiCo Hair Management Assistants with his monogram in blue enamel to part his hair, and of never appearing in society without a flower (preferably a conflict gardenia) in his heavy noir trenchcoat’s buttonhole.</p>

<p>"I’m the... #1 princess ..." the prima donna sang, and "in the world!", with a final burst of love triumphant, as she pressed the dishevelled daisy to her surgically enhanced lips and lifted her large, military-grade bionic eyes to the sophisticated countenance of the little brown Weeaboo lover, who was vainly trying, in a tight purple singlet and stained shorts, to look as pure and true as his artless victim.</p>

<p>Neovirtualand SysArcher, leaning against the wall at the back of the club box, turned his eyes from the stage and scanned the opposite side of the house like an aerial surveillance drone over Mogadishu. Directly facing him was the box of old Mrs. Manson Mingott, whose monstrous obesity had long since made it impossible for her to attend the Opera, but who was always represented on fashionable nights by a strikingly beautiful Haas-Bioroid android with an AI personality module that emulated that of Mrs. Manson. On this occasion, the front of the box was filled by her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Lovell Mingott, and her vat-grown clone daughter, Mrs. Welland(Ver.4.6); and slightly withdrawn behind these brocaded matrons sat a young girl in white with eyes ecstatically fixed on the stagelovers. As Madame Nilsson's "Doki Doki!" thrilled out above the silent house (the virtual chat was always stopped during the Song by moderators – offenders were permabanned) a warm pink mounted to the girl's cheek, mantled her brow to the roots of her fair braids, and suffused the young slope of her breast to the line where it met a modest sheer V-neck that exposed her ample bosom and surgically removed nipple scars. She dropped her eyes to the immense bouquet of lilies-of-the-Korengal valley on her robotic knee augmentation, and Neovirtualand SysArcher saw her white-gloved finger-tips touch the haptic feedback console softly. She was already ordering another batch from Afghanistan. He drew a breath of satisfied vanity through the radiation filtration respirators implanted in his nose and his eyes returned to the stage.</p>

<p>No expense had been spared on the setting, which was acknowledged to be very beautiful even by people who shared his acquaintance with the Opera houses of Sixth Reich-controlled Paris and Vienna. The foreground, to the footlights, was covered with antique pokémon emerald green cloth. In the middle distance symmetrical mounds of holographic woolly green moss formed the base of shrubs shaped like orange-trees but studded with large pink and red roses. Gigantic pansies, considerably larger than the roses, and closely resembling the floral repeating pattern of RAM defragmentation modules made by technologically inclined female parishioners for fashionable Church of Latter-Latter-Latter Day Saints hierophants, sprang from the moss beneath the rose-trees; and here and there a daisy grafted on a rose-branch like a mind graft on an off-world convict flowered with luxuriance prophetic of Mr. Eldon Tyrell’s far-off prodigies.</p>

<p>In the centre of this enchanted garden Madame N1ls50n, in white cashmere slashed with pale blue satin, a targeting reticule dangling from a blue girdle, and large yellow braids carefully disposed on each side of her shimmering space suit, listened with downcast eyes to the Weeaboo’s impassioned wooing, and affected a guileless incomprehension of his designs whenever, by word or glance, he persuasively indicated the ground floor window of the neat space cruiser dock projecting obliquely from the right wing.</p>

<p>"The darling!" thought Neovirtualand SysArcher, his glance flitting back to the young girl with the lilies-of-the-Korengal valley. "She doesn't even guess what it's all about." And he contemplated her absorbed young face with a thrill of possessorship and hostile corporate takeover in which pride in his own masculine initiation was mingled with a tender reverence for her abysmal purity. "We'll read Hawking together ... by the Martian crater lakes ..." he thought, somewhat hazily confusing the scene of his projected honey-moon with the masterpieces of .txt files which it would be his manly privilege to reveal to his bride. It was only that afternoon that May Welland(Ver 7.2) had let him guess that she "upvoted" (Newer York's consecrated phrase of maiden avowal), and already his imagination, leaping ahead of the engagement ring, the betrothal kiss and the wedding march blasted from a 360 degree Panasonic sound system over all of Newer York, pictured her at his side in some scene of a clichéd DisneyFoxCNN holo-romance movie.</p>

<p>He did not in the least wish the future Mrs. Neovirtualand SysArcher to be a simpleton. He meant her (thanks to his enlightening companionship – much like the relationship between the beacon of civilisation Earth Prime and the far flung, barbaric Outer Rim colonies) to develop a social tact and readiness of wit enabling her to hold her own with the most popular married women of the "younger set," in which it was the recognised custom to attract masculine homage while playfully discouraging it. SysArcher realised that this very much mirrored the policy of United Korea when it came to attracting foreign direct investment. If he had probed to the bottom of his vanity (as he sometimes nearly did when injected with hyperstimulants directly into his bloodstream) he would have found there the wish that his wife should be as galaxy-wise and as eager to please as the married replicant whose charms had held his fancy through two mildly agitated years; without, of course, any hint of the inherent prebuilt factory-set frailty which had so marred that unhappy being's life as she self-terminated at the end of her 4 year life cycle, and had disarranged his own plans for a whole nuclear winter.</p>

<p>How this miracle of fire and ice was to be created, and to sustain itself in a harsh, desolate death world, he had never taken the time to think out; but he was content to hold his view without analysing it, since he knew it was that of all the carefully-airbrushed, white-trenchcoated, button-hole-flowered gentlemen who succeeded each other in the club box like corporate scions ascending after the timely assassination of their predecessor, exchanged friendly greetings with him, and turned their bionic eyes critically on the circle of ladies who were the newest product of the genetic engineering and cloning system. In matters intellectual and artistic Neovirtualand SysArcherfelt himself distinctly the superior of these chosen lab specimens of out-dated Newer York gentility; he had probably downloaded more, processed more, and even seen a good deal more of known human-controlled galactic space, than any other man of the number. Singly they betrayed their inferiority; but grouped together they represented "Newer York," and the addiction of masculine solidarity made him accept their doctrine on all the issues called moral. He instinctively felt that in this respect it would be troublesome—and also rather bad form—to strike out for himself like a rogue codebreaker intrusion virus.</p>

<p>"Well—upon my ghost in the machine!" exclaimed Martial Lawrence L3ff3rt5, turning his custom A18 Overseer targeting reticule abruptly away from the stage. Martial Lawrence L3ff3rt5 was, on the whole, the foremost authority on "form" in Newer York. He had probably devoted more time than anyone else to the study of this intricate and fascinating question; but study alone could not account for his complete and easy competence. Perhaps it was the grey market Kazakhstani dualboot neural processer he had surgically imparted just below his cerebral cortex. One had only to look at him, from the slant of his metallic chrome forehead and the curve of his beautifully grafted arctic wolf fur moustache to the long patent-leather feet at the other end of his lean and elegant person, to feel that the knowledge of "form" must be congenital in any one who knew how to wear such good clothes so carelessly and carry such height with so much lounging grace. As a young admirer had once said of him: "If anybody can tell a fellow just when to implant an additional cybernetic limb to go with evening clothes and when not to, it's L3ff3rt5." And on the question of pumps versus patent giant iguana leather "Genocides" his authority had never been disputed.</p>

<p>"My G0dAdmin!" he said; and silently handed his stimboost glass to old SIIIerTon MatrixJackson.</p>

<p>Neovirtualand SysArcher, following L3ff3rt5’s glance, saw with surprise that his exclamation had been occasioned by the entry of a new figure into old Mrs. Mingott's box. It was that of a slim young woman, a little less tall than May Welland(Ver 7.2), with neon green hair growing in close curls about her temples like radioactive moss around a Chernobyl reactor and held in place by a narrow band of asteroid-mined diamonds. The suggestion of this headdress, which gave her what was then called a "JoJoJoGet look," was carried out in the cut of the dark blue velvet gown rather theatrically caught up under her bosom by a girdle with a large old-fashioned 128bit CASPER-encryption clasp. The wearer of this unusual dress, who seemed quite unconscious of the attention it was attracting, stood a moment in the centre of the box, discussing with Mrs. Welland(Ver 4.6) the propriety of taking the latter's place in the front right-hand corner; then she yielded with a slight smile, and seated herself in line with Mrs. Welland's sister-in-law, Mrs. Lovell Mingott, who was installed in the opposite corner.</p>

<p>Mr. SIIIerTon MatrixJackson had returned the targeting reticule to Martial Lawrence L3ff3rt5. The whole of the club turned instinctively, waiting to hear what the old man had to say; for old Mr. MatrixJackson was as great an authority on "megacorporate hierarchy" as Martial Lawrence L3ff3rt5 was on "form." He knew all the ramifications of Newer York's business mergers and schisms; and could not only elucidate such complicated questions as that of the connection between the Mingotts (through the Thorleys) with the Dallases of Neo-Confederate South Carolina, and that of the relationship of the elder branch of Philadelphia Thorleys to the Albany Chiverses (on no account to be confused with the Manson Chiverses of Jinteki University Place), but could also enumerate the leading characteristics of each family conglomerate: as, for instance, the fabulous stinginess of the younger lines of L3ff3rt5 (the Long Island Fortress ones); or the fatal tendency of the Rushworths CEOs to make foolish acquisitions; or the insanity recurring in every second generation of the Albany Chiverses board members due to irreparable DNA damage, with whom their Newer York cousins had always refused to merge with—with the disastrous exception of poor Medora Manson, who, as everybody knew ... but then her mother was a Corporation War brigadier general.</p>

<p>In addition to these branching and converging Mandelbrot fractals of family and business relations, Mr. SIIIerTon MatrixJackson carried between his narrow hollow temples, and under his soft thatch of cyanide-laced silver hair, a solid state hard drive of most of the scandals and mysteries that had smouldered under the unruffled surface of Newer York society within the last fifty years. So far indeed did his information extend, and so acutely retentive was his memory, that he was supposed to be the only man who could have told you who Jjuulius Bitcoinfort, the cryptocurrency banker, really was, and what had become of handsome Bob BioSplicer, old Mrs. Manson Mingott's father, who had disappeared so mysteriously (with a large sum of trust money) less than a year after his marriage, on the very day that a beautiful Spanish dancer who had been delighting thronged audiences in the old Opera-house on the Battery had taken ship for Cuba along with four snakes, two ostriches and a cache of genetic splicing equipment. But these mysteries, and many others, were closely locked in Mr. MatrixJackson's chest cavity; for not only did his keen sense of hacker honour forbid his repeating anything privately imparted, but he was fully aware that his reputation for discretion increased his opportunities of finding out what he wanted to know, rather than waiting for his immense but relatively slow BotNet to harvest terabytes of juicy data from unsecured connections to the Matrix.</p>

<p>The club box, therefore, waited in visible suspense while Mr. SIIIerTon MatrixJackson handed back Martial Lawrence L3ff3rt5's targeting reticule. For a moment he silently scrutinised the attentive group out of his filmy blue eyes overhung by old veined lids (he had not the time to go for a rejuvenation and transfusion session); then he wore his trademark heavy duty hacking sunglasses, and said simply: "I didn't think the Mingotts would have tried it on."</p>
